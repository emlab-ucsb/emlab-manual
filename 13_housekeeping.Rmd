# Housekeeping

## Timekeeping

Every month, full-time Academic employees (Specialists, Academic Coordinators, Postdocs) accrue **8 hours of sick time and 16 hours of vacation.** You are responsible for making informed decisions about how to use your accruals (which you can find online at UCPath), but please notify your supervisor whenever you are out sick via slack or email, and let them and your teams know of any vacation time you plan to take well in advance so your projects and teams will run smoothly in your absence. More about requesting vacation in the next section

At the end of every month, you will need to fill out your timecard on [Kronos timekeeping system](https://timekeeping.ucsb.edu/). You only need to record any sick or vacation days you took (in increments of 8 hours), you do not need to record hours worked. This means that if you took no vacation or sick time in that month, you approve a blank timecard.  

Once you log in, make sure you are recording your hours in the “Previous Pay Period” (you can adjust this using the drop down menu at the top right-hand corner). On the days when you need to log hours, select “Vacation” or “Sick” under “Pay Code,” and enter “8” under “Amount.” We are not able to log anything less than one full day on this system (i.e., no half sick or vacation days). 

## Vacation

For vacations longer than five days, email your supervisor at least three weeks in advance of your planned time off outlining your dates and coordinate with your project teams to ensure that you will not be missing any critical deadlines or discuss how they can be covered by other project members. For shorter periods of time off (e.g., 1-2 days), aim to give your supervisor and project teams at least a few days notice. 

Please communicate with your team/s and use your calendar to note when you will be out of town, out of the office, or working remotely (and ensure your calendar is up to date).

## Travel

Many of our projects require us to travel domestically and internationally. The University has various rules and procedures that are designed to (hopefully) make it as easy as possible for you to plan your trips, avoid covering expenses with your own money ahead of time, and easily get reimbursed for expenses you do incur while traveling. The [MSI travel page](https://msi.ucsb.edu/administration/travel) details information, rules, and restrictions for work-related travel.

### Paying for travel before you leave

There are two ways the University can pay for your travel expenses prior to your trip:

1. **Travel Advances:** if you prefer to make your own reservations, might have to cancel/change your tickets, or plan to stay in non-traditional accommodations (e.g., AirBnb) you may have to pay for some of your travel expenses out of pocket before you go. Though you can’t submit a complete travel reimbursement form until after you return from your trip, you can get a partial reimbursement for expenses you cover prior to traveling by applying for a travel advance. 
    - Use [this form](https://msi.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/MSI-Advance-Worksheet_0.pdf) to apply for a travel advance at least 10 days before your departure provided that you have already paid for, and can provide itemized receipts as proof of trip components.
    - When you return, you will claim the amount you were given in your advance on your travel reimbursement form so that you don’t double count any expenditures.
  
2. [**Connexxus**](https://travel.ucop.edu/connexxus/) - UC’s travel service that can be used to book flights, rental cars, or hotels. These reservations are directly billed to a University account, so there is no out-of-pocket cost.
    - Know that you may not have as many options to choose from as the University has policies about which flights, hotels, and rental car companies are acceptable. Know that reservations made through Connexxus cannot be cancelled, changed or refunded, so you should be certain about your travel schedule before booking anything. 
    - You can use Connexxus yourself or have Donna Dobis (donna.dobis@ucsb.edu) in MSI book your travel through Connexxus for you.
    - When you return, you will still need to submit a reimbursement request for any expenses you incurred and paid for out-of-pocket while traveling.

### Travel reimbursements

**Domestic travel**

When you return from domestic travel, you will need to fill out [MSI’s Domestic Travel Worksheet](https://msi.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/MSI-Domestic-Travel-Worksheet.pdf) to be reimbursed for any expenses you incurred and paid for out-of-pocket while traveling. To be reimbursed for U.S. travel, you will need to submit a reimbursement form with itemized receipts for all of your purchases – you cannot claim per diem for a domestic trip.

Per UC policy, when traveling in the U.S. you can only be reimbursed up to $275/ night for lodging, and up to $62/day for meals and incidentals. If you exceed either maximum, know that you must cover the rest with your own funds. If you can’t find a hotel below $275/night, you will need to provide evidence of this (i.e. you must show (print and attach) rates from other hotels in the nearby area that are higher than yours) to corroborate your claim that you got the cheapest available rate. Only then can you be reimbursed the full amount. There are no exceptions for exceeding the daily maximum for food.

You cannot be reimbursed for alcohol, so if you need to be reimbursed for a meal where alcohol was purchased, subtract the cost of the alcohol from the total you list on your reimbursement form. 

**International travel** 

When you return from traveling outside of the country, you will need to fill out [MSI’s Foreign Travel Worksheet](https://msi.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/docs/MSI-Foreign-Travel-Worksheet.pdf) to be reimbursed for any expenses you incurred while traveling. 

The most straightforward mechanism we recommend for reimbursing international travel is the State Department’s per diem rates, which are location-specific. On the [State Department’s website](https://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp), you can look up the country and city where you traveled to find the maximum daily lodging and food (M & IE) rates. The combined total of those two rates is the maximum allowable amount, per day of your trip, that you can be reimbursed. 

When claiming per diem for a trip, we ask that you please keep track of your general expenses while traveling so you can determine the number of days of per diem needed to cover your travel costs. Because the State Department per diem rates can be much higher than actual expenses, you will often claim less days of per diem than you travel. 

To be clear, we are not asking you to keep receipts for everything you purchase abroad. But if you can keep a general running tab of your expenses, you will know how many days of per diem you’ll need to claim in order to be fully reimbursed. You can claim days in increments of quarter days.

### Travel insurance

All employees and affiliates of the University are eligible for comprehensive trip insurance at no cost. This policy offers much more than just lost luggage replacement.

For example:
- If you are injured or become ill while travelling on University business, it covers all medical treatment/hospitalization costs, as well as any expenses for changed itineraries or modes of transport.  
- If you have to be extracted from your destination due to political violence or a weather-related emergency, all costs are covered.

If you book your travel through UC Travel/Connexxus, you are automatically enrolled in this coverage. Even if you paid for your travel yourself and submit a reimbursement after the fact, you can still get insurance coverage. You can register your trip [here](https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html).
