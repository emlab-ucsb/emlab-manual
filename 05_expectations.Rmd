# Expectations

## Work environment

We are currently piloting a hybrid working model from March until June 2022. We will test this model out until the summer, gauging how the hybrid model affects productivity, efficiency, work-life balance, creativity, lost or gained opportunities for collaboration and our overall mission of conducting innovative, solutions-oriented research examining the power, limitations, and design of market-based approaches to drive environmental and social good. We will send out a survey to the staff and leadership team later in late spring/early summer to evaluate how the hybrid model is going and then the leadership team will re-assess and adapt our working model as needed this summer.

The health and safety of our team remains the most important priority and, as such, these guidelines are entirely subject to change based on emerging conditions (e.g., all the variants) and [University](https://www.ucsb.edu/COVID-19-information/return-to-campus-requirements) and county guidelines, which could change before or during the course of this pilot.

### Hybrid working model pilot overview

- All Santa Barbara-based emLab staff will have [assigned office space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VZPN_Ecz0ylSm6DJhV-pNkTGzA-G3FKOh-bqx2lm-8/edit) and be eligible for a hybrid work schedule with some time in the office and some time working from home.
- All Santa Barbara-based staff will be expected to spend some time in the office during the week: at least one day while the campus mask mandate is still in place and eventually ideally 2-3 days/week once the mask mandate is lifted and depending on what works best for you (See Harvard Business Review’s tips for [setting a hybrid work schedule](https://hbr.org/2021/10/how-to-set-a-hybrid-work-schedule-that-works-for-you?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_campaign=mtod_notactsubs)).
- During this transition, please work with your project teams, officemates and supervisor to set a schedule that works for you and use your google calendar to note which days you will be working from home and which days you will be in the office.
  - Project managers should reach out to their teams and discuss which kinds of meetings would be best to prioritize for in-person time.
  - Folks sharing an office should set up a meeting to discuss schedule and office norm preferences and adapt and communicate openly as things may change.
  - There is inherent value in both the physical office and remote locations — we encourage you to consider which locations best enable you to most effectively carry out certain tasks or aspects of your work.
- We want to provide everyone with the autonomy to set a schedule that works for you, while encouraging some face time with your colleagues to build community, share ideas across projects, brainstorm and problem solve within projects, and foster genuine connections across emLab.

**Logistics**

- Meetings 
  - See [hybrid meeting guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFwvSoYVPUwM1V56-60S-ff5Qowt7ALgrI48QIIjsAw/edit?usp=sharing) for details on hybrid meetings.
- Hours and remote work 
  - All staff are responsible for setting their own hours within the work week.
  - Individual work hours, as well as sick and vacation leave, should be communicated with their supervisor, as well as coordinated with other team members as needed.
  - Staff will be expected to work from the office if there are internet issues or deficiencies that impact their work.
- Equipment and commuting
  - emLab will provide equipment for one workstation that will include: a laptop or desktop computer, a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and up to two computer monitors. emLab will also provide a desk and chair in your university office, and miscellaneous office supplies (notebooks, pens, etc.) as needed. if you need equipment, please notify your supervisor for approval and contact Erin to assist with re-allocation or purchasing. 
  - The University provides these resources [(link)](https://www.tps.ucsb.edu/commuter-options) for commuting to and from campus. 
- Guests and visitors in the office and in meetings	
  - Guests and visitors must complete the [on-demand screening survey](https://ucsb-641309.workflowcloud.com/forms/5f252a35-800a-4015-8256-ecd9b5c68a96) to determine if they are cleared to be on campus and if and when they are required to wear a mask or quarantine.
  - Based on the screening survey as of July 2021, it appears that fully vaccinated visitors are allowed on campus without restrictions. Individuals who are not vaccinated or decline to disclose that information may be required to be quarantined for 7-10 days if they are traveling from out-of-state. This guidance is not publicly listed by the University, so it's best to have guests complete the survey in advance of scheduling trips or meetings to see if any quarantining is necessary and they can plan accordingly.
  - Please send any guests or campus visitors this survey in advance to determine if they will be able to access campus meetings spaces and offices. 

**Protocols for working from the office**

- Enroll in and complete the daily symptom survey to obtain a “cleared to work” digital badge to work on campus. Enrollment information can be found [here.](https://t.e2ma.net/click/zgo54e/3j5nqn/nr0wix)
- This is implied in the daily screening, but please do not come into the office if you are exhibiting any symptoms at all or are not feeling 100%. 
- Information about where you can go for both asymptomatic and symptomatic testing is [here](https://www.ucsb.edu/COVID-19-information/testing).
- All Santa Barbara-based emLab staff must be vaccinated and have submitted proof of vaccination through the University [here](https://studenthealthoc.sa.ucsb.edu/login_dualauthentication.aspx) or have received an approved exemption before they will be allowed in any UC facility or office or to participate in any University programs.
- All employees must also complete the “COVID-19 Returning to Work” training course required by Cal/OSHA, which is available through the [UC Learning Center](https://t.e2ma.net/click/zgo54e/3j5nqn/3j1wix).
- Please abide by [University guidance related to COVID precautions](https://www.ucsb.edu/COVID-19-information) for in-office work and in-person meetings. 
- Cleaning materials and hand sanitizers will be available for office use.

As stated above, the health and safety of our team is the most important thing above all else. As we learned this past year, things can rapidly change, and we will continue to adapt as needed. If you do not feel safe coming into the office or if there are additional measures that you would like to see in place, please talk to Michaela or your supervisor. Exceptions to these guidelines are permitted after they have been discussed and approved by your supervisor. 

## Time management

It is important for every individual to understand and manage their workloads and responsibilities, and to ask for help when it is needed. Team members should prioritize the tasks that are most important and urgent. If you are having challenges prioritizing tasks, speak with your supervisor to discuss priorities.

emLab project staff are allocated to one or more projects, which is likely to shift over time as projects come to completion and new projects are launched. Staff should be aware of their general percentage time allocation across projects, which are tracked in the project tracking sheet in Drive. Due to the adaptive nature of our work, these percentages are likely to vary daily, weekly or monthly, and should be used as guidelines rather than strict allocations. If staff are feeling either underutilized or overstretched, they should speak with their supervisor.

## Meetings and events
emLab hosts a variety of events to foster a deep sense of community across roles and programs, and provide opportunities for our team to be as collaborative, functional, and fully integrated as possible. 

We know things can come up that sometimes make it impossible to join everything, but we want to clarify that we do expect everyone to do their best to participate in team events, particularly the Monday Morning Meetings. Beyond that, if you find yourself with a lot on your plate, please use your discretion to decide when your participation will yield high returns, and do not feel obligated to participate in events that you don’t think will be a valuable use of your time. Each of us has unique interests, areas of expertise, and professional goals, and we trust that those will inform the decisions you make for yourself!
