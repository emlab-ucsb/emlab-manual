# Work Environment

# Time management
It is important for every individual to understand and manage their workloads and responsibilities, and to ask for help when it is needed. Team members should prioritize the tasks that are most important and urgent. If you are having challenges prioritizing tasks, speak with your supervisor to discuss priorities.

emLab project staff are allocated to one or more projects, which is likely to shift over time as projects come to completion and new projects are launched. Staff should be aware of their general percentage time allocation across projects, which are tracked in the project tracking sheet in Drive. Due to the adaptive nature of our work, these percentages are likely to vary weekly or monthly, and should be used as guidelines rather than strict allocations. If staff are feeling either underutilized or overstretched, they should speak with their supervisor.

# Meetings and events
emLab hosts a variety of events to foster a deep sense of community across roles and programs, and provide opportunities for our team to be as collaborative, functional, and fully integrated as possible. 

We know things can come up that sometimes make it impossible to join everything, but we want to clarify that we do expect everyone to do their best to participate in team events, particularly the Monday Morning Meetings. Beyond that, if you find yourself with a lot on your plate, please use your discretion to decide when your participation will yield high returns, and do not feel obligated to participate in events that you don’t think will be a valuable use of your time. Each of us has unique interests, areas of expertise, and professional goals, and we trust that those will inform the decisions you make for yourself!

Here’s an overview of emLab events and the objectives of each:
- Monday Morning Meeting: learn about current work at emLab, celebrate successes, share team-wide announcements
