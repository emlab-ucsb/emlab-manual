# Offboarding


In your last week, please be sure to return your computing equipment, keys, etc. to Erin and clean your desk. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, please make sure all project files and data have been uploaded to the emLab Shared Drive and all repos have been transferred to the emLab GitHub organization. 

Lastly, schedule an exit interview with Michaela and your supervisor to discuss your overall experience with emLab, any feedback you have for the team, and opportunities for future collaboration.
